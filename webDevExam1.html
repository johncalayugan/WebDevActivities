        <p>
            Japan was settled about <em>35,000 years ago</em> by <em>Paleolithic people from the Asian mainland.</em> 
            At the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago, a culture called the Jomon developed. 
            Jomon hunter-gatherers fashioned fur <em>clothing, wooden houses, and elaborate clay vessels.</em>

            <b>ii. Classical Japan</b>
                Classical Period (538-1185)

            The Classical Period opened with a big leap in the political, social, and artistic aspects of the 
            Japanese society, including the fruition of the Yamato rule and the beginnings of Buddhism in Japan. 
            This formative stage is known as the Asuka period.
