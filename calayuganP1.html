                Already the NBA's career scoring leader, LeBron James reached uncharted territory Tuesday night by 
            becoming the only player in NBA history to score 39,000 career points.James reached the milestone with a 
            3-pointer in the first quarter of the Los Angeles Lakers' 131-99 victory over the Utah Jazz. He finished with 
            17 points in 24 minutes as the Lakers completed an unbeaten run through Group Play in the NBA In-Season Tournament.
            “I got congratulated by my teammates and coaches, (but) I haven't had an opportunity to really wrap my head around what 
            that means,” James said. “There's been so many great players that came across this league since the beginning of time, 
            and so many great scorers. To be able to accomplish something that's the first of anything, I think that's always pretty cool. 
            It's a wild moment, that's for sure.”James continues to play at an elite level in his 21st season, averaging 26.4 points, 8.2 
            rebounds and 6.5 assists. At his current pace — and assuming good health — James should reach 40,000 points later this season.
